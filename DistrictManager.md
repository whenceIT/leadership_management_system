escalated risk oversight, future-period follow-ups, and talent pipeline
development.

 Ensure all branches under supervision are aligned with the $100M valuation
framework.
 Validate branch-reported data, especially:
o Month-1 default rates

in day-to-day management.

 Ensure branch managers are planning for next-month targets while
managing current performance.

compliance breaches.

5. Supervision Guidelines: What NOT to Do
To prevent micromanagement and role duplication, District Managers MUST NOT:
 Perform daily loan approvals or disbursement oversight (Branch Manager’s role)
for branches under their supervision, save for the mother branch.
 Intervene in routine LC performance management (Branch Manager’s role).
 Handle Month-1 collections (Branch Manager’s role).
 Manage branch-level staffing schedules or daily operations.
Instead, District Managers should focus on:
 Validation of reported numbers.
 Forward-looking risk oversight (next month’s risks, aging defaults).
 Cross-branch coordination.
 Strategic escalation only.

6. Performance Management &amp; Funding Pool

A. Value Creation &amp; Funding Mechanism
Based on the KPIs &amp; Funding Table in the strategic direction document, District
Managers can access a monthly incremental funding pool for branch developments
of any kind tied to verified value creation:

KPI Value Created (Monthly) Funding (25% of Value)
Cross-Branch Default Reduction K69,600 K17,400

 Performance bonuses/rewards for cross-branch initiatives.

B. Review &amp; Consequences
