Implemented clear separation of concerns based on:
-Loan amount thresholds
-Loan status
-Position hierarchy


Real-time Priority Actions now:
-Display role-specific actions per loan event
-Show Branch Manager: review and approval requirement (e.g., K50,000 loan created)
-Show Risk Manager: threshold alert for high-value loans
-Ensure each position only sees what is relevant to their responsibility
