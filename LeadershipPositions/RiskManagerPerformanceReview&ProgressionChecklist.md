RISK LOSS CALCULATION EXAMPLES

Fraud Scenarios &amp; Prevention Value:

Scenario Typical

Loss Detection Method Prevention Value

Ghost Loan (1) K25,000 LMS audit + client
verification

K25,000 +
investigation costs
saved

LC Cash Theft K2,500 per
month

Surprise cash count +
client calls

K30,000 annual +
reputational protection

Collateral
Fraud K75,000 Independent valuation +
registration check

K75,000 + recovery
costs avoided

System
Manipulation K50,000+ User access controls +
transaction monitoring

K50,000 + system
integrity

Preventive Control ROI Calculation:
Investment in Control: K40,000 (software + training)
Losses Prevented Year 1: K200,000
ROI = [(200,000 - 40,000) / 40,000] × 100 = 400%
