The Policy &amp; Training Manager (PTM) serves as the institutional architect of

policies are not merely documents but living frameworks that prevent loss, enable
growth, and protect the institution&#39;s $100M valuation pursuit. Simultaneously, the
PTM designs and delivers training interventions that transform policy knowledge into
consistent, compliant, and high-performance behaviors across the organization.
This is a non-revenue-generating but critical risk-mitigating and value-enabling
role that progresses through Tiers 3, 2, and 1 based on the depth of risk prevention,
the effectiveness of training ROI, and strategic contribution to institutional
