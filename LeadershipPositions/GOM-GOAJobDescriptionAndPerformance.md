3. TIER STRUCTURE &amp; PROGRESSION CRITERIA

A. Loss Prevention Metrics (All Tiers)
1. Vacancy Cost Avoidance

 Formula: (Number of positions filled) × (Average daily revenue per station:
K1,333) × (Days vacancy reduced)
 Example: Filling 10 positions 5 days earlier = K66,650 value preserved

Page 4 of 11

2. Fleet Efficiency Gains

 Formula: (Reduction in fuel/maintenance costs) + (Increased vehicle
availability × visits per day × conversion rate × avg. loan value)

3. Compliance Penalty Avoidance

 Tracked: NAPSA/NHIMA fines, regulatory penalties, contract breaches

4. Downtime Reduction

 Internet, system, or facility downtime converted to lost revenue opportunity

B. Revenue Enablement Metrics (GOM Tiers 2 &amp; 3)
1. Staff Productivity Increase

 Formula: (Reduced admin tasks time) × (Number of staff) × (Average
revenue per hour worked)
2. Process Speed Acceleration

 Example: Loan disbursement process time reduced by 20% = More loans
processed monthly
3. Resource Optimization

 Shared services savings, bulk purchasing discounts, reduced waste

C. Strategic Alignment Metrics (GOM Tier 1)
1. $100M Valuation Contribution

 Operational efficiency as % of valuation growth target
 Risk mitigation impact on stakeholder confidence

2. Institutional Scalability

 Systems supporting 2x branch expansion without proportional cost
increase
3. Leadership Impact
