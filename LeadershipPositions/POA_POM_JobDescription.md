4. QUANTIFIED VALUE FRAMEWORK

A. Performance Loss Prevention Metrics

Performance Issue Calculation Formula Monthly Loss Example

Under-
disbursement Loss

(K40,000 target - actual
disbursement) × number of
underperforming LCs

10 LCs @ K20,000 shortfall = K200,000
loss

Excess Uncollected
Cost

(Actual uncollected - K5,000 limit) ×
risk weighting (1.5x for &gt;K10,000)

5 LCs @ K10,000 excess = K75,000 risk
exposure

Sub-minimum
Salary Drain

(K5,000 salary - revenue
contribution) × months retained 3 LCs for 3 months = K45,000 net loss

Opportunity Cost

(Top performer revenue -
underperformer revenue) × position
count

5 positions @ K60,000 gap = K300,000
opportunity

B. Intervention Effectiveness Metrics

Intervention Type Value Created Measurement Method
Performance
Recovery

K50,000–K150,000 per
recovered LC

(Post-intervention revenue - pre-intervention) ×
sustainability factor

Page 6 of 13
Early Identification K30,000–K80,000 per early-

detected case (Potential losses avoided through early action)

Process
Optimization

K100,000–K300,000
institutional

(Time saved × revenue rate) + (errors prevented
× cost)

Training ROI K40,000–K120,000 per

trained cohort (Performance lift × number of staff × duration)

C. Strategic Enablement Value

Strategic Contribution Valuation Impact Measurement Approach
Performance Risk
Mitigation 2–5% valuation protection (Probability of performance failure × potential

impact)

Productivity Growth 1–3% annual valuation

acceleration

(Performance improvement rate × valuation
multiple)

Capacity Optimization 10–20% expansion capacity

unlock (Improved productivity × available positions)
