1. JOB PURPOSE
The Risk Manager serves as the institutional guardian against financial loss, fraud,
and operational breakdown. This role is the frontline defense in a technology-driven
microfinance environment, where risk emerges from digital systems, cash handling,
human behavior, and process gaps. The Risk Manager ensures that the Loan
Management System (LMS) is not just an operational tool but a controlled
environment, and that all transactions—from K500 short-term loans to K50,000+ motor
vehicle financing—are executed within a framework of integrity, accuracy, and
compliance.
This is a non-revenue-generating but critical value-preserving role that progresses
through Tiers 3, 2, and 1 based on risk prevented, fraud detected, losses avoided,
and the strength of the control environment built.
