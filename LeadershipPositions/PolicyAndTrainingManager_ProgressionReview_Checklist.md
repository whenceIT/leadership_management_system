CHECKLIST NOTES &amp; GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES

Register
 Training ROI must follow standardized calculation methodology
 Stakeholder feedback must be collected through structured surveys
2. Risk-Adjusted Performance:

Page 9 of 11

progression
 Transparency in reporting is non-negotiable

Training ROI Calculation Template:
ROI = [(Monetary Benefits - Training Costs) / Training Costs] × 100
Example: Collateral Training for 20 LCs
 Training Cost: K20,000
 Reduction in inadequate collateral cases: 5 incidents avoided
 Average loss per case: K60,000
 Monetary Benefit: 5 × K60,000 = K300,000
 ROI = [(300,000 - 20,000) / 20,000] × 100 = 1,400%
