1. Job Purpose
The Payroll Loans Manager is a Revenue-Innovating Manager responsible for
developing, managing, and scaling a portfolio of payroll-deducted loan products while
ensuring unit sustainability and capital growth through strategic innovation, revenue
trading, and risk-managed diversification. This role is not confined to traditional
payroll loans but includes variations of short-term, medium-term, and collateral-

balance liquidity risk, employer payment delays, and capital constraints while
driving revenue and net income comparable to branch/district/provincial managers to
determine seniority and reward levels.

medium-term, civil servant loans, private sector payroll loans).
 Create innovative loan variations to attract diverse client segments while
managing liquidity risk.
 Explore and implement revenue trading opportunities, especially in Motor
Vehicle Collateral Loans (K10,000.00 – K100,000.00).
 Ensure product compliance with employer agreements and regulatory
standards.

 Pursue Motor Vehicle Loan expansion with institutional funding support when
qualified clients are identified.

 Manage employer payment delay risk (government and private sector).
 Implement liquidity buffers to handle delayed payroll deductions.
 Monitor concentration risk with single employers or sectors.
 Ensure timely recovery of defaulted payroll loans through employer
coordination.

D. Revenue Growth &amp; Strategic Expansion
 Drive revenue trading initiatives with new/existing branches.
 Develop strategic employer partnerships beyond civil service.
 Expand Motor Vehicle Loan portfolio as primary capital growth driver.

E. Performance &amp; Reporting
 Report on unit profitability, capital efficiency, and sustainability.
 Track KPIs tied to revenue, net income, and capital growth.
