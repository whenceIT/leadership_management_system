The Management Accountant serves as the architect and guardian of institutional
financial integrity, scalability, and strategic insight. This is not a traditional
accounting role but a transformational leadership position charged with building a

executive role that progresses through Tiers 3, 2, and 1 based on system
implementation success, financial control effectiveness, strategic partnership
impact, and measurable contribution to institutional scalability and valuation
